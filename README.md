# Polynomial_regression
Predicting the result by generating a polynomial equation using skilearn library in python and also in R


In the dataset,salaries are given for different post in there company.Company is hiring people and asking
there previous salaries and by comparing candidate's previous post salary with there salaries and predicting
wheather the candidate telling truth or lying.   

In polynomial regression model we form a mathematical equation using multiple linear regression algorithm.
firstly,I multiplied the input by itself to form a (ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + --- + z = output(salaries)).
